## Hello

This note mirrors the “Meet” section on the website so that it stays reachable even if the main domain goes offline. Here you’ll find a condensed version of who I am, how I work, and why I believe that careful attention is the best starting point for change.

If the primary site is down, read the archival copy any time: https://github.com/alexbon-com/alexbon.com/blob/main/content/en/pages/about.mdx.
